# Analyst-GPT
Welcome to the AnalystGPT project! Harness a powerful document analysis tool that effortlessly converts PDFs into insights. Craft a GPT-driven analyst without complex fine-tuning. Seamlessly analyze documents, streamlining financial processes with ease.

# Leveraging Your Own Documents in a Langchain Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to effectively utilize a ChromaDB vector store in a Langchain pipeline to create a GPT Analyst. You can seamlessly integrate PDF-based documents into your Langchain pipeline, all without the need for fine-tuning.

## Overview

This project showcases the process of leveraging a ChromaDB vector store within a Langchain pipeline. By doing so, you can create a GPT Analyst that can analyze PDF-based documents alongside an LLM model, all without the complexities of fine-tuning.
